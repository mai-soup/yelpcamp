# YelpCamp

A full stack project that's part of [Colt Steele's Web Dev Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). While Colt provides full code for his implementation, I try to build things on my own by loosely following his plan before watching his solutions.

The project utilises HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express, Bootstrap 5.
